i want to create a web application, which is like evernote but, data will be stored on users end (like users google drive) and data will be in encrypted format will can be only decrypted using our web application.

user can store passwords, notes, some images, files(like word, pdf, xsl, etc),

login will be using google(gmail) as we are going to store data in google drive of the user.

my expectations are UI should be good, and backend working should be proper.

also i want to deploy application having budget 5K to 7K rupees for a year.

so make a plan or stratergy, what all things i need, which techonology you recommend, what all feilds will be there in UI, what menu bar and all..

To create a web application like Evernote with the specified requirements, here's a plan and strategy you can follow:

Technology Stack:

Front-end: React.js or Vue.js for building the user interface.
Back-end: Node.js with Express.js for the server-side application.
Database: Since the data will be stored in the user's Google Drive, you don't need a traditional database. However, you may need to store some application-related data, for which you can use a lightweight database like MongoDB or Firebase.
Authentication: Use Google OAuth 2.0 for user authentication and authorization to access their Google Drive.
Encryption: Use a strong encryption algorithm like AES-256 or ChaCha20-Poly1305 for encrypting and decrypting user data.
Google Drive API: Integrate with the Google Drive API to read, write, and manage files in the user's Google Drive.
File Handling: Use libraries like File-Saver or pdfmake for handling different file types like PDFs, Word documents, Excel sheets, etc.
User Interface (UI):

Landing Page: A simple and clean landing page with a brief introduction to the application and a "Sign in with Google" button.
Dashboard: After successful authentication, users should be redirected to the dashboard, which will be the main interface for the application.
Sidebar: A sidebar or navigation menu with options for different features like Notes, Passwords, Files, and Settings.
Editor: A rich text editor or a markdown editor for creating and editing notes.
Password Manager: A section for storing and managing passwords, with options to generate strong passwords and copy them to the clipboard.
File Manager: A file explorer-like interface for managing files stored in the user's Google Drive. Users should be able to upload, download, preview, and delete files.
Settings: A section for users to manage their account settings, change encryption keys, and access application preferences.
Deployment and Hosting:

Front-end: You can host the React or Vue.js application on a static web hosting service like Netlify or GitHub Pages.
Back-end: For the Node.js server, you can use a cloud hosting platform like Heroku or DigitalOcean.
Domain and SSL: Purchase a domain name and set up an SSL certificate for secure communication between the client and server.
With a budget of 5,000 to 7,000 rupees for a year, you can consider using free or low-cost hosting services and relying on open-source libraries and tools as much as possible.

Please note that this is a high-level plan, and you may need to address additional concerns like data privacy, security, scalability, and performance as you progress with the development.

Sure, let's discuss the UI flow, navbar, and landing page for your web application.

Landing Page:

The landing page is the first thing users will see when they visit your website. It should be simple, clean, and visually appealing. Here are some elements you can include on the landing page:

Header: A prominent header with the application's name and a brief tagline or description.
Hero Section: A hero section with a visually appealing image or illustration that captures the essence of your application.
Key Features: A section highlighting the key features of your application, such as secure data storage, encrypted notes, password management, and file storage.
Testimonials (Optional): If you have any existing users or early adopters, you can include testimonials or quotes from them.
Call-to-Action: A prominent call-to-action button or link that encourages users to sign in with their Google account.
Navbar:

The navbar should be present on all pages of your application, providing easy access to different sections and features. Here are some potential items you can include in the navbar:

Logo: Your application's logo, which can also serve as a link to the dashboard or home page.
Notes: A link or dropdown menu for managing notes.
Passwords: A link or dropdown menu for managing passwords.
Files: A link or dropdown menu for managing files stored in the user's Google Drive.
Search (Optional): A search bar or icon for searching notes, passwords, or files.
User Profile: A user profile icon or dropdown menu that displays the user's name or email and provides access to account settings or a logout option.
UI Flow:

After a user signs in with their Google account, they should be directed to the dashboard or home page. Here's a potential UI flow:

Dashboard: The dashboard should provide an overview of the user's notes, passwords, and files. It can display recent notes, a list of passwords, and a file explorer-like interface for managing files.
Notes Section: Clicking on the "Notes" link or dropdown menu in the navbar should take the user to a dedicated section for managing notes. This section should have a rich text editor or markdown editor for creating and editing notes, as well as a list or grid view of existing notes.
Password Manager: Clicking on the "Passwords" link or dropdown menu in the navbar should take the user to the password manager section. This section should allow users to create, view, and manage their passwords. It can also include a password generator tool and options for copying passwords to the clipboard.
File Manager: Clicking on the "Files" link or dropdown menu in the navbar should take the user to the file manager section. This section should display a file explorer-like interface, allowing users to upload, download, preview, and delete files stored in their Google Drive.
Settings: The user profile dropdown menu in the navbar should provide access to account settings, where users can manage their personal information, change encryption keys, and adjust application preferences.
Throughout the application, you should maintain a consistent design language and user experience, with clear and intuitive navigation, readable typography, and appropriate use of icons and visual cues.
